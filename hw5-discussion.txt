As the tests indicate, there is quite a difference in the performance between
executing the command inside the monitor versus executing it outside of the monitor.
Inside the monitor, 0.75 transactions were executed every millisecond compared to 
3.4 transactions being executed when done outside the monitor.

In a real world scenerio, this would have a dramatic effect when millions of transactions
would need to be performed every second.  The question, of course, is what caused such
a drastic difference in performance.  Basically, when the command is executed inside the 
monitor, we place a lock on the command queue.  This means that while that one command
is being executed, no other commands can be loaded onto the queue, and no other commands can
be pulled off the queue and executed by another thread while the original request is 
still being processed.  The effect is that every transaction is now blocking the execution of
other transactions.  

Conversely, when transactions are processed outside of a lock, multiple transactions can be 
processed concurrently as long as threads are available to execute the commands.  This
effectively eliminates the bottleneck.  It must be noted that there is no danger of accounts
becoming out of sync here because individual accounts are already placed into a lock when
transactions are being executed for that account.
